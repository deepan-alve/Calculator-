# Google Search Box

This web application mimics a Google search box, allowing users to input and evaluate mathematical expressions, including trigonometric functions. The app features a celebratory confetti animation that triggers upon evaluation and a dark mode toggle for enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Mathematical Expression Evaluation**: Supports basic arithmetic and trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan).
- **Confetti Animation**: A fun confetti effect that appears for 4 seconds when an answer is processed.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout, including dark mode support.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for expression evaluation, animations, and dark mode toggle.

## Getting Started
